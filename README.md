# Migrate Multiple Siloed API Management Instances to a Federated Workspace-Based Instance  

This repo contains tools and guidance to migrate entities such as APIs and products from multiple siloed Azure API Management instances into a single, workspace-based federated API Management instance.  

Entities are migrated using the [Azure APIOps Toolkit](https://github.com/Azure/APIOps) and custom PowerShell scripts. The APIOps migration process involves extracting resources from each siloed instance, organizing them into a workspace folder structure, and publishing them to the federated instance. PowerShell scripts are available to migrate some entities not handled by APIOps. After migration, complete any necessary manual configurations. See [Migrated entities](#migrated-entities) for details on entities that can be migrated and limitations.

## Workspaces overview 

Workspaces in Azure API Management introduce a new level of autonomy for an organization's API teams, allowing them to create, manage, and publish APIs more efficiently and securely. These workspaces provide isolated administrative access and API runtime, empowering API teams while enabling the central API platform team to maintain oversight through centralized monitoring, API policy enforcement, compliance, and unified API discovery via a developer portal. Functioning like "folders," each workspace contains APIs, products, subscriptions, named values, and related resources, with access managed through Azure's role-based access control (RBAC). Additionally, each workspace is linked to a workspace gateway that routes API traffic to backend services.

## Prerequisites

1. [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell?view=azps-12.3.0#install)
1. [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli#install)
1. Azure subscription access - Ensure you have an active Azure account with Contributor access to manage API Management instances.
1. One or more source API Management instances, and one destination federated API Management instance. Currently, the destination instance must be in the Premium tier.
1. [Azure APIOps Toolkit](https://azure.github.io/apiops) for API Management - Choose installation for [Azure DevOps](https://azure.github.io/apiops/apiops/3-apimTools/apimtools-azdo-2-3-new.html) or [GitHub](https://azure.github.io/apiops/apiops/3-apimTools/apimtools-github-2-4-new.html). Use the APIOps release [v6.0.2-alpha.1.0.3 or higher](https://github.com/Azure/apiops/releases).

## Install migration scripts

1. Open a bash shell.

1. Create a folder for the migration activity.

    ```
    mkdir apim-silo-to-federated
    cd apim-silo-to-federated 
    ```

3. Clone this migration tools repository.

    ```
    git clone  https://github.com/Azure-Samples/api-management-workspaces-migration
    ```

## Migrate entities using APIOps

See the APIOps documentation for detailed guidance on setting up and running APIOps pipelines for the migration. The following are high level steps. 

1. Create a public repository named `federated-apim-apiops` that's used for the migration.

1. Run the APIOps *extractor pipeline* for each siloed API Management instance. For multiple siloed instances, run the extractor pipeline multiple times to extract the artifacts in different folders.

   Specify different folder names where you want to extract the artifacts in the pipeline, for example, silo001, silo002, etc. 

1. Clone the `federated-apim-apiops` repository under the root folder `apim-silo-to-federated` that you created previously.

    ```
    git clone <repository_url>   
    ```
    
1. In the `.\api-management-workspaces-migration\create-workspace.ps1` script, review the variables defined for source and destination directories and workspace names. The script assumes two siloed instances and workspaces, but you can modify it for a different number of instances.

    ```
    $srcDir1 = ".\federated-apim-apiops\silo001"
    $srcDir2 = ".\federated-apim-apiops\silo002"
    $destDir = ".\federated-apim-apiops\artifacts-workspace"
    $newWorkspace1 = "<name of the workspace1>"
    $newWorkspace2 = "<name of the workspace2>"
    ```

1. Run the PowerShell script to merge siloed artifacts with a workspace folder structure:  

    ```
    PS> .\api-management-workspaces-migration\create-workspace.ps1  
    ```

1. Go to the `federated-apim-apiops` folder.

    ```
    cd federated-apim-apiops 
    ```

1. Push the `artifacts-workspace` workspace folder to the  `federated-apim-apiops` repository.

    ```
    git push federated-apim-apiops
    ```


1. Run the APIOps *publisher pipeline* from the `federated-apim-apiops` repository to the federated API Management instance, using the contents of the `artifacts-workspace` folder.

## Migrate other entities

This repository contains separate PowerShell scripts to migrate users, groups, and subscriptions from a siloed API Management instance to a federated API Management instance. These entities aren't migrated through APIOps. Other entities, such as developer portal content and identity providers, require manual configuration.

To migrate users, groups, and subscriptions:

1. Get an Azure access token.
 
    ```
    az login
    az account set â€“subscription <subscriptionId> 
    $ACCESS_TOKEN=(az account get-access-token --resource=https://management.azure.com --query accessToken --output tsv)   
    echo "Access Token: $ACCESS_TOKEN"   
    ```
 

1. In the `create-groups-and-groupusers.ps1`, `create-subscriptions.ps`, and `create-users.ps1` scripts in the `api-management-workspaces-migration` folder, set the variables for the siloed and federated API Management instances and for access tokens:  

    #### Siloed API Management instance 
    
    ```
    $siloAPIMsubscriptionId = ""  # Replace with your actual subscriptionId
    $siloAPIMresourceGroupName = ""  # Replace with your actual resourceGroupName 
    $siloAPIMserviceName = "" # Replace with your actual serviceName
    $siloAPIMapiVersion = "2023-09-01-preview"  
    ```
    
    #### Federated API Management instance 
    
    ```
    $federatedAPIMsubscriptionId = ""  # Replace with your actual subscriptionId
    $federatedAPIMresourceGroupName = ""  # Replace with your actual resourceGroupName
    $federatedAPIMserviceName = "" # Replace with your actual serviceName
    $federatedAPIMapiVersion = "2023-09-01-preview"  
    ```

    #### Access tokens  
    
    ```
    $siloAPIMaccessToken = "" # Replace with your actual token
    $federatedAPIMaccessToken = ""  # Replace with your actual token
    ```

1. Run the PowerShell scripts to migrate the entities.
 
    ```
    PS> cd  .\apim-federated-to-siloed 
    PS> .\api-management-workspaces-migration\create-users.ps1 
    PS> .\api-management-workspaces-migration\create-groups-and-groupusers.ps1 
    PS> .\api-management-workspaces-migration\create-subscriptions.ps1
    ```

1. Run the preceding two steps for each siloed instances.
